Queries is a workbench to interact with relational databases, with initial support for Postgres.

## Features

- View relevant contextual information (schemata, tables, views and columns) when writing SQL.

- SQL statements are parsed and verified at the client side for immediate feedback and faster debugging.

- Support for encrypted connections via SSL/TLS, allowing you to interact safely with remote databases.

- Statements are executed asynchronously when possible, reducing execution time for long statement sequences.

- Build line, scatter and bar graphs without external tools using plain SQL by aggregating your data according to a JSON specification.

- Export results as plain CSV files or build dynamic HTML reports from tables and views.

## Help

See the [project wiki](https://github.com/limads/queries/wiki) for help with using the application.
